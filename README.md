  MeloDash: Audio Experience Design
	
## Introduction

Melodash is a running game based on real time music analyzed. Player’s objective is to dodge obstacles that are automatically generated by the music. Our group’s focus was to develop the game further by completing beat detection, and adding extra features such as music visualisation. Beat detection was taken place by analyzing two elements of the music: frequency band and energy of the signal. Different frequencies were categorized to different types of obstacles. Then, if the signal is above certain energy, the obstacles will be generated in the game. Using these two features, obstacles are more diverse and speed of game is automatically calibrated.
